Hi, I'm Dmitry – nice to meet you! Read [my story](/about) if you'd like to know me better.

> TODO: write that story

In this first Quick Bit, I'm exploring my motivation for writing and starting this blog.

The thing is, I've been drawn to writing for a while, and finally with a helpful motivation kick from [Blogging for devs](http://bloggingfordevs.com/) I got down to it.

To start, I decided to go with a short-form series of "Quick Bits", where I expect to write about my personal journey in the world of tech, web, making and maybe a few other related topics. Some of this stuff may get personal and opinionated – that's by design.

So why write?

In writing, I can see a lot of value for my long-term personal growth:

1. **Learn in public.** I'm a big fan of this idea, originally found it [**here**](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/). I see this blog as a platform for me to try it out to see if it works for me.

2. **Develop my writing voice**. I admire people who can express themselves a) clearly and concisely and b) authentically and honestly. I'd like to learn this skill too!

3. **Practice consistent, daily action** towards a big goal. I believe that most great things in life are achieved by consistent daily progress, even if it's just 15 minutes a day.

4. **Learn to express myself authentically and honestly** on the web. I admire people who, even with a big following stay honest, open and can share their ups & downs without skewing the picture.

5. **Improve my thinking** through writing. I've seen people who swear on it that writing helped them to become better thinkers. I'd like to explore that side of writing too.

Since it's a personal journal, I don't really expect all of these notes to be useful to anyone (if they are, I'll be happy!).

It's more like a paper trail for myself, to be able to look back and see where I was a few years back, what I was thinking about and why.
