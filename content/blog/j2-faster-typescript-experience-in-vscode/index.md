It's no secret that **TypeScript can get slow in VSCode**. Especially so for code-bases with non-trivial type inference (I'm looking at you, <a href="https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui">ChakraUI</a>).

Ever found yourself waiting for the compiler to catch up with you as you type new code or fix errors?
This quickly gets frustrating, what's worse it slows down your feedback loops.

Here I'm sharing a simple tip that saved me hours of my life over the last 3 years working with TypeScript codebases (especially large ones!).

I wish I knew it earlier when I was just getting started with TypeScriptâ€¦

## How to fix slow TypeScript compilation

Hereâ€™s the trick:

1. Run a separate TypeScript process in watch mode in a terminal tab.
2. Keep it running as you write code â€” itâ€™ll respond to changes and highlight errors a lot faster compared to VSCode.

In my experience, the difference can be striking (see the screenshot). It seems to depend on the project and npm libs itâ€™s using, but the general pattern is pretty consistent across different projects and TS versions I worked with.

## Integrate with your TypeScript project

Hereâ€™s how to make it more convenient in your TypeScript project, step-by-step:

1. Add these 2 NPM scripts to your package.json:

```
"scripts": {
  ...
  "typecheck": "tsc",
  "typecheck:watch": "tsc -w"
  ...
}
```

2. Now run npm run `typecheck:watch` in a terminal tab (I like to do it in VSCodeâ€™s Terminal panel to keep things in the same window).

This starts a separate TypeScript process in the watch mode. Itâ€™ll take some time to start, but itâ€™ll be much faster to re-compile your code incrementally as you change your code.

3. Use npm run typechek if only need to do the check once. Itâ€™ll run faster than the watch mode.
   I find it handy e.g. before deploying to make sure the build will be succesful.

## ðŸ™Œ Thatâ€™s it!

I hope this tip helps you to have a faster TypeScript workflow and to be more happier at work (it certainly helped me!).
